# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
  As companies grow and proliferate, so do their employees' age. Pewlett-Hackard is gearing itself up for an upcoming "silver tsunami" in which its older workforce will up and retire from the company--leaving the company with vacancies and potential new mentors for their mentorship program. This analysis was perfomed to let PH know that even though they are getting ready to experience a massive amount of retired workers--they can be prepared in knowing which positions these retirees will leave vacant and which ones of them might become potentital new participants in their mentorship program.

	Many of the employees at PH have had mulitple positions and have even been promoted during their time at PH. This intersting fact could be useful when hiring future positions because the new hires may not be able to do all of the things that the company's retirees have been able to do.

This table tells us which positions are up for retirement and how long that retiree was in that position. This is useful because it can give higher-ups an idea of how long it takes to get good at a position until its time for a promotion or if someone wants to change career paths.

Theres 1550 retirees eligible for the mentorship program. This might be the most useful table for the people overseeing the mentorship program. Because, even though there were  a lot of retirees only a smaller subset will be eligble for the program. And here the list is ordered down to that smaller group and their employee number, name, position, and the length of time they were in those positions. 

## Summary

* In total, there will 90,398 upon the completion of the "silver tsunami". With 29,414 senior engineer positions open, 28,252 vacant senior staff positions, 14,222 engineer roles, 12,243 staff roles, 4,502 technique leader positions, 1,761 asssistant engineer roles, and 2 manager positions.
* No, theres only 1,550 eligble retirees for the 90,398 positions. However, this is not to say that 1 position needs 1 mentor: but, this would mean that there was 1 mentor per 59 people.

Just as we did with the counts of titles, it is wise to look at the numbers of each title that will be lacking mentors upon completion of the "silver tsunami".
